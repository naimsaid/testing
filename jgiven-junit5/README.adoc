= Example for JGiven w/ JUnit 5

== About

This show an almost simple example of http://jgiven.org/[JGiven^]

== Features

The following features are shown in this example (see `FeatureCalculator.java`):

. you use standard `@Test` syntax as you would use for JUnit
. you use a fluent syntax with reusable states in separate classes
. state between the given/when/then stages is shared between objects using injection
. nice support for not yet implemented scenarios using `@Pending` annotation
. very nice HTML output of the report, including output of attachments (please see the JGiven Arquillian example project for this).

A feature in progress is the rendering of the Gherkin in the Asciidoc format.

== How to run

Install maven and run as follows:

   mvn clean verify

To look at the results, open the folder `target/jgiven-reports/html/index.html` to see <<report,the report>>.
