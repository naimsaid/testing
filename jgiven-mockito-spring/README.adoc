= Example for JGiven with Spring Boot

== About

This is a demo of http://jgiven.org/[JGiven^] together with http://site.mockito.org/[Mockito^] and https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot^].

WARNING: This is an advanced example with several frameworks involved like you would experience it in a real project.
This is not for the faint of heart!

== The Application

=== Scope

This Spring Boot application gives you a web calculator that can be accessed from different users.

The state of the calculator is shared by all users and is persisted in a JPA database (H2-in-memory only for now).

Each user has the following options using the GUI:

 * reset
 * increment
 * refresh (to see if someone else has changed the calculator)

=== Development Environment

This example application makes use of http://mapstruct.org[MapStruct^] and https://projectlombok.org[Lombok^].
Please install the necessary plugins in your IDE and enable annotation processors.

=== Running the application

Use the following command to run the application:

----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

Once the application is running you can open it in your browser using the URL +
http://localhost:8080

You will see the following content in your browser:

=== Design of the Application

This demo application is using a hexagonal structure, also known as ports-and-adapters design.
See http://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture[this blob post^] for more information.

The core application functionality, the Calculator, resides in a package called "domain".

The domain can be accessed by a facade that resides in the "application" package.
The facade takes care of orchestrating different calls within the "domain" package (in this case: retrieving the state from the repository and re-activating it).

Then there are different adapters.
There are different adapters

* to start the application from the command line
* to store its data in JPA and
* to access the functionality via REST.

Each adapter must not communicate with any other adapter.
It must only access the classes in the domain through the facade provided by "application".

An adapter can provide implementations for interfaces defined in the "domain".
The JPA adapter for example provides an implementation for the Repository.
Using inversion-of-control these implementations are injected where needed.

Once an adapter connects to the outside (either the database or a REST endpoint in this case), it will map the internal domain object to an external representation:
The REST adapter will map to DTO instances, the repository adapter will map to JPA instances.
The mapping serves as an anti-corruption layer.
This way the domain object can change when the business functionality requires this.
It also keeps the domain objects clean from JPA and JSON annotations.

== Implemented Tests

To test this application several different tests have been implemented.
Each test has a different focus what it will test.
The more infrastructure a test creates, the slower it will run.
Some test use JGiven to show nice BDD-reports to the owner of the application.
Other tests are just technical Unit tests that don't provide BDD reports.

Even the technical unit tests could have used JGiven, but this is something that needs to be decided on a per-project basis.
In this project they are shown side-by-side for educational purposes.

CalculatorResourceTest::
This test uses _@WebMvcTest_ to create a minimal Spring context without web and JPA elements.
The facade _CalculatorApplication_ is mocked so only the _CalculatorResource_ and the connected Mappers are tested.
As some classpath scanning is done, the speed is "medium".

CalculatorRepositoryTest::
This test uses _@DataJpaTest_ to create a minimal Spring context with only JPA elements and the repository.
It tests all API methods of _CalculatorRepository_ against a database.
As database migration scripts will run as well as some classpath scanning, the speed is "medium".

FeatureCalculatorDomain::
This tests the functionality in the domain.
All adapters that are injected are mocked, in this case the _CalculatorRepository_.
As this is of interest to the business and contains business rules, it is implemented as a JGiven test.
This test doesn't need Spring, therefore it uses Mockito's  lightweight injection mechannism.
The magic in this test case happens in _GivenCalculatorDomainStage_ -- please have a look.
This test is very fast, as no Spring context needs to be initialized.

FeatureCalculatorContainer::
This tests end-to-end REST calls to the APIs.
For this the web and the JPA context are started.
It uses JGiven to inject Spring beans into the different Stages.
This can be quite useful.
This kind of test is rather slow.
A variant of this test could mock some of the beans to provide static resources. Usually the facade in "application" is a good place to mock.

FeatureCalculatorGui::
This tests end-to-end including the GUI.
For a GUI-Test it runs Chrome and Selenium.
This behaves like the JGiven arquillian example:
When you run this on the command line, it will run the tests headless.
When you run the test in your IDE, you'll need to start the chromedriver first.
Please see the sub-folder _chromedriver_ for details how to do this.
A variant of this test could mock some of the beans to provide static resources. Usually the facade in "application" is a good place to mock.

== How to run the tests

Install maven and run as follows:

----
mvn verify
----

To look at the results, open the folder `target/jgiven-reports/html/index.html` to see <<report,the report>>.

This reports will only contain the JGiven tests, not the standard JUnit tests.

For the report of all tests (JGiven and JUnit) see `target/site/surefire-report.html`.

WARNING: The timing shown in the overall surefire reports doesn't necessarily show the initialization time of the Spring Boot contexts.
You will only notice the startup times when you run the tests in your IDE.
